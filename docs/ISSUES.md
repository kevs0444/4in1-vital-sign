# Known Issues & Bugs

## Frontend Data Reflection
- [ ] **BMI Page (`BMI.jsx`)**: Weight and Height live data is not reflecting on the UI.
- [ ] **Body Temperature Page (`BodyTemp.jsx`)**: Temperature data is not reflecting on the frontend.
- [ ] **MAX30102 Page (`Max30102.jsx`)**: Heart rate and SpO2 data are not reflecting on the frontend.

## Data Saving
- [ ] **All Pages**: Measurement data is not being correctly saved/passed to the next step (Result/Summary).

## General
- [ ] Ensure "Kiosk Mode" (Slave Mode) is strictly enforced; frontend must control the timer.
